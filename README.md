# Supership's Scala Implementation of Pseudo-Mutable Data Types with Zipper Monad.

This project attempts to enable Scala's various sorts of immutable data types, more precisely structured data types, to be pseudo mutable with implementing corresponding zipper monad.

Hopefully, the generalized implementation of zipper monad would be more appreciated, though, so at this moment, this implementation is still weak for handling several data types, but "Rome was not built in a day", we decieded to make very limited zipper implementation for JSON to start with.
